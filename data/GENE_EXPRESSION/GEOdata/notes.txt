Gene expression was measured in the tumor from untreated or ACT mice on day 1, 3, 5 and 7. Gene expression was also measured in the tumor on day 3, 5 and 7 from ACT mice with anti-IFNg or control Rat IgG antibodies treatment.

The microarray data are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (series accession number GSE57304; sample accession numbers GSM1379331–GSM1379344).

After download, headers were removed from the raw text files so the feature tables can be loaded as CSV files. 

The key.txt (or.csv)  link the files to the conditions/days.
