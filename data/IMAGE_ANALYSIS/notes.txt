classifiers are trained on the cropped sections of the selected images (there is one from each timepoint).

The batch processing in ilastik doesn't seem to work (?). Therefore instead do the following: Open a trained classifier, then add all the images from Exp16_merged as inputs. Then modify the csv export location inside elastik to wherever, then run "export all".
